* itunes-emms

A tool to assist in escaping iTunes while keeping years of play-counts, comments and ratings.

The function track-data is used to create an edn representation of the plist data which can then be accessed with commands like this:
#+begin_src clojure
(def track-data-edn (track-data "Library.xml"))
(get-in track-data-edn ["Yes" "Going For The One"])
#+end_src

track-data will also take a list of fields to select the fields that will be included in the track data. This defaults to [:name :location :rating :play-count :comments]
There are some more hints on use in the main.clj file, in the comment block at the end.
