* itunes-emms

Some tools to assist in escaping iTunes while keeping years of play-counts, comments and ratings.

The function track-data is used to create an edn representation of the plist data which can then be accessed with commands like this:
#+begin_src clojure
(def track-data-edn (track-data "Library.xml"))
(get-in track-data-edn ["Yes" "Going For The One"])
#+end_src
track-data will also take a list of fields to select the fields that will be included in the track data. This defaults to [:name :location :rating :play-count :comments]
This can then be used to populate the mpdev stats.db and the mpd sticker.db with playcounts ratings and comments.

There is also a fn to add album covers in the sizes that emms uses to every album directory in the music collection.

There are some more hints on use in the clj files, in the comment block at the end.
